A simple carbon stock calculator for locations within Africa made for [2023-2024 Penn State Schreyer Honors Thesis](https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/9352kfc5480). Carbon inputs are based on agroforestry and biochar practices. Calculations are limited to a few species.

App is run through [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://carboncapture.streamlit.app/).
